# Palitip-rs - Calculate tips that are palindromes

## Just a fun Sunday program in rust-lang

What if my bill + tip at a restaurant always summed to a number which
is a palindrome?  For fun, write a rust program to show some
palindromic tips around the target tip percentage.

If you always do this, it could be a sort of sort of checksum :-)

So, this program will do the following:

List some possible tips that are nearby palindromes.

## Example

```shell
cargo run

```

## Bugs / Missing Features

 - needs some UI polish
 - should have an api for an alternative to the cli only

## Dependencies

Just the std::io library
